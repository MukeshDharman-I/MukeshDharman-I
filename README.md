## About Me

I am a student pursuing B.Tech in Artificial Intelligence and Machine Learning at Rajalakshmi Engineering College. My interest in machine learning and deep learning began in high school, and I have consistently worked to build my skills and apply them to practical projects. I enjoy taking on new challenges, both in academic coursework and hands-on development.
